   RAIN — sw.js (service worker)
   Makes the app shell (HTML/CSS/JS + the emergency-critical pages) load
   offline. This is deliberately NOT a "cache everything forever" worker:

   - App-shell files (HTML/CSS/JS/icons/manifest) are precached on install
     and served network-first with a cache fallback, so an online device
     always gets the current build and an offline device still opens using
     whatever was last cached.
   - Navigating to any known page falls back to the cached copy of THAT
     page if the network is unavailable (network-first, cache fallback),
     and falls back to the cached dashboard if the exact page was never
     visited before.
   - Live data requests (Supabase, USGS, OpenWeather, the /api/* Vercel
     functions, PHIVOLCS/volcview) are deliberately left alone — they go
     to the network as normal. Offline *readings* for that data are
     handled by assets/js/offline-store.js writing known-good snapshots
     to localStorage, not by the service worker caching API responses.
     That keeps "what the user sees offline" honest and explicit instead
     of silently replaying a stale network response.
